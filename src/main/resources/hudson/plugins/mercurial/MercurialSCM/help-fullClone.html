  Clone the entire repository.
  <p>
  Without this option, Hudson clones repositories using the <code>--rev</code> option.  The
  clone will contain only the specified changesets and their ancestors.  On very large
  repositories, ancestor calculation can increase clone time and load on the Mercurial
  server.

  <p>
  With this option, Hudson will do a full clone.  On very large repositories this
  can decrease clone times at the expense of larger clones.
