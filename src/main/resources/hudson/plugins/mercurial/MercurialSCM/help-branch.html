<div>
  Specify the branch name if you'd like to track a specific branch in a repository. Leave this field
  empty otherwise, to track the "default" branch. Can be configured as a job parameter using a dynamic expression
  like <pre>${branch</pre>.
  <p>
  You can as well use a changeset ID here or a tag, maybe set as a job parameter as <pre>${changeset}</pre>,
  for the job to build a specific revision. Please note that, in such case, scm polling will not be relevant and
  should be disabled.
