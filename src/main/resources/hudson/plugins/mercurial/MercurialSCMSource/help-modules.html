<div>
  Reduce unnecessary builds by specifying a comma or space delimited list of "modules" within the repository.
  A module is a directory name within the repository that this project lives in. If this field is set,
  changes outside the specified modules will not trigger a build (even though the whole repository is checked
  out anyway due to the Mercurial limitation.)
