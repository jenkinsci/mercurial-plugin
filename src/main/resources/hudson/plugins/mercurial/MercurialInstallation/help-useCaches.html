    When checked, Hudson will maintain a cache of the Mercurial repository in use
    by a project. (Does not apply to projects using the Forest extension.) The
    cache will be kept on the master node, updated on demand, and additional
    caches may be kept on slave nodes running this job. All jobs pointing to the
    same repository location will share a single cache (even if they use different
    named branches). If you have several jobs using the same repository location,
    or one job using multiple workspaces, enabling caching can substantially
    reduce the load on the Mercurial server and speed up Hudson builds and polling.
