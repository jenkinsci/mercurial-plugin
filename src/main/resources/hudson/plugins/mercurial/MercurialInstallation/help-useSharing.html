    <p>When checked, different clones of the same repository will
    <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ShareExtension">share</a> the
    history portion of the Mercurial.</p>

    <p>Enabling this option also automatically enables the caching option.</p>

    <p>If you have several jobs using the same repository location,
    or one job using multiple workspaces, enabling sharing should
    substantially reduce the disk usage on your nodes.</p>

    <p>The share extension is distributed with Mercurial 1.3 and later.</p>
