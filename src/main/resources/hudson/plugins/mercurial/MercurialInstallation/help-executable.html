    Location of actual Mercurial executable.
    <code>INSTALLATION</code> will be substituted with installation directory.
    Normally <code>INSTALLATION/bin/hg</code> but you could specify another name
    such as <code>INSTALLATION/my-mercurial.py</code> or even look for Mercurial
    in the default path (leaving installation directory blank) using just <code>hg</code>.
    If you are configuring per-node tool home locations,
    you may leave the installation directory undefined on some nodes,
    in which case just <code>hg</code> (i.e., from <code>$PATH</code>) is used.
